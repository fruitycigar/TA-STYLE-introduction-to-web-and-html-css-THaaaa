    <h1>Honda Integra</h1>
    <p>This might come as a bit of a surpirise, but the Honda Integra is quite possibly one of the greates cars to come out of the Honda stable. Former Emperor Akihito's favorite car was an Integra which he used to drive within the palace grounds!
      The legacy of the Intgera brand culminated with the release of the Type R, univerally heralded as one of the greatest front wheel drive cars to have ever been made. Sporting a tiny sub-2 litre engine with one of the highest output per litre handled like a dream
      and proved that FWD cars didn't have to be boring.
